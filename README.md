# pwmenable
A dumbed-down pwmconfig script which I only use for its side effect. (activating the fans on my Radeon R9 380X Nitro)

This script is the result of removing many stuff from pwmconfig.
It won't do anything besides activating the fans of my Tonga XT / Amethyst XT [Radeon R9 380X / R9 M295X]
Pwmconfig does something which as a side effect turns my video card fans on, avoiding overheating.
