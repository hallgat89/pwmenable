# pwmenable
Scripts to control the fans of my Radeon R9 380X Nitro <br>
<br>
This script is the result of removing many stuff from pwmconfig.<br>
It won't do anything besides activating the fans of my Tonga XT / Amethyst XT [Radeon R9 380X / R9 M295X]
One script sets the pwm to max, the other one controls it based on 2 temperature values.
